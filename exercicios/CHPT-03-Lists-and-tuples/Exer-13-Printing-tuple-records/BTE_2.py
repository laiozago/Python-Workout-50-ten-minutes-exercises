'''
Define a list of tuples, in which each tuple contains the name,
length (in minutes), and director of the movies nominated for best picture
Oscar awards last year. Ask the user whether they want to sort the list
by title, length, or director’s name, and then present the list sorted
by the user’s choice of axis.
